# Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis
This project is part of **Data Science and Machine Learning** course on **Coding Ninjas**. In this I got Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset which contains data for over 14000 tweets, around 11000 tweets for training and around 3000 tweets for testing. My task is to predict sentiment of tweet i.e. positive, negative or neutral of testing dataset.

I use Multinomial Naive Bayse and Random Forest Classifier model to predict sentiment
